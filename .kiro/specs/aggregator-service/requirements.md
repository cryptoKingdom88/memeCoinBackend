# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a high-performance real-time token trade aggregation system designed to handle high-frequency trading data (tens of thousands of trades per day) for meme coins. The system will provide real-time aggregated metrics for multiple time windows (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 1hour) using an efficient sliding window algorithm with Redis-based data storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Trade Data Processing

**User Story:** As a trading platform, I want to process incoming token trade data in real-time, so that I can provide up-to-date trading metrics to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new token trade data arrives from Kafka THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the trade data within 10ms
2. WHEN trade data is received THEN the system SHALL group trades by token address for block-level initial aggregation
3. WHEN block-level aggregation is complete THEN the system SHALL trigger token-specific goroutines for detailed processing
4. IF trade data parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other trades
5. WHEN processing trade data THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and prevent data loss

### Requirement 2: Multi-Timeframe Sliding Window Aggregation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see aggregated trading metrics for different time windows (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 1hour), so that I can analyze trading patterns across various timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new trade data arrives THEN the system SHALL calculate aggregations for all configured time windows (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 1hour)
2. WHEN calculating aggregations THEN the system SHALL track sell/buy counts, trading volume, and price changes for each timeframe
3. WHEN time window boundaries are crossed THEN the system SHALL automatically remove expired data from calculations
4. WHEN aggregating data THEN the system SHALL use incremental calculation (add new + remove old) instead of full recalculation
5. IF no index changes occur for a timeframe THEN the system SHALL reuse previous aggregation values for longer timeframes to optimize performance

### Requirement 3: Redis-based Data Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want trade data and aggregation indices stored in Redis with automatic cleanup, so that the system can handle high-frequency data without memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing token data THEN the system SHALL use Redis with the following structure:
   - `token:{address}:trades` (List) for trade data
   - `token:{address}:indices` (Hash) for timeframe indices  
   - `token:{address}:aggregates` (Hash) for timeframe aggregation values
   - `token:{address}:last_update` (String) for last update timestamp
2. WHEN a token's first trade occurs THEN the system SHALL set Redis TTL to the maximum timeframe duration (1 hour)
3. WHEN no trades occur for the TTL period THEN Redis SHALL automatically expire and remove the token's data
4. WHEN updating Redis data THEN the system SHALL use atomic operations to prevent race conditions
5. WHEN accessing Redis THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and pipeline operations for optimal performance

### Requirement 4: Efficient Index-based Calculation Algorithm

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the aggregation algorithm to use index-based sliding windows, so that the system can handle high-frequency data with minimal computational overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new trade data arrives THEN the system SHALL update timeframe indices to track data boundaries
2. WHEN calculating aggregations THEN the system SHALL iterate backwards from current index to find data outside time windows
3. WHEN expired data is found THEN the system SHALL subtract its values from previous aggregations
4. WHEN new data is processed THEN the system SHALL add its values to the aggregation totals
5. WHEN index updates are complete THEN the system SHALL store updated indices and aggregation values atomically
6. IF calculation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and maintain previous valid aggregation state

### Requirement 5: Background Maintenance and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automatic background maintenance to handle edge cases and ensure data consistency, so that the system remains reliable under all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the maintenance interval elapses (configurable, default 60 seconds) THEN the system SHALL scan all active tokens in Redis
2. WHEN scanning tokens THEN the system SHALL identify tokens with no aggregation updates in the last 10 seconds
3. WHEN stale tokens are found THEN the system SHALL perform manual aggregation calculations for those tokens
4. WHEN manual aggregation is complete THEN the system SHALL update the token's last_update timestamp
5. IF Redis connection fails during maintenance THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 6: Concurrent Processing and Performance

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to handle concurrent token processing efficiently, so that it can scale to handle thousands of active tokens simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple tokens THEN the system SHALL use separate goroutines for each token's aggregation
2. WHEN goroutine count exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement worker pool pattern to control resource usage
3. WHEN accessing shared resources THEN the system SHALL use appropriate synchronization mechanisms
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for aggregation updates
5. IF goroutine crashes THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully without affecting other token processing

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want configurable parameters and comprehensive monitoring, so that I can tune performance and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the service THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables including:
   - Time window definitions (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 1hour)
   - Maintenance interval (default 60 seconds)
   - Redis connection parameters
   - Worker pool sizes
2. WHEN processing trades THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for monitoring:
   - Trades processed per second
   - Aggregation calculation latency
   - Active token count
   - Redis operation performance
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL emit warnings and performance metrics

### Requirement 8: Data Consistency and Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the system to maintain data consistency even during failures, so that trading metrics remain accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN partial updates occur due to failures THEN the system SHALL detect and recover inconsistent state
3. WHEN system restarts THEN the system SHALL resume processing from the last known good state
4. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL log the issue and reinitialize affected token data
5. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL use Redis Lua scripts or distributed locks to ensure atomicity
